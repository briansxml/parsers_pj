SM 180 / SM 180 HK;With its weight of either 190 or 235 kg (with heating/cooling jacket) and the dimensions of 965 x 420 x 420 (L x W x H in mm), the SM 180 is the smallest of Siefer’s machines. Despite its compact design, the SM 180 convinces with its ability to deliver an impressive performance in numerous industries – from biotechnology and animal feed to the food, paper and bitumen industries. Thanks to its high drive power of up to 45 kW, the SM 180 achieves speeds of up to 5,400 revolutions per minute and a throughput of up to 28 cubic metres per hour (based on water). It processes particles with a diameter of up to 15 mm with ease. This means that even big production tasks are no problem for our smallest machine.;https://siefer-trigonal.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/siefer_trigonal_sm-180.jpg;https://siefer-trigonal.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/siefer_trigonal_sm-180.jpg;"Technical data | SM 180 | Throughput based on water [m?/h] | 4 – 28

SM 290 / SM 290 HK;The SM 290 can be used variably in many sectors – whether it is agrochemicals, food, the paper and recycling industry, or paints, animal feed and cosmetics. The machine weighs either 265 kg or 275 kg (with heating/cooling jacket) and is characterised by its extremely compact construction in relation to its performance (1,000 x 500 x 500 mm and 1,000 x 580 x 580 mm with heating/cooling jacket). Compared with the SM 180, the SM 290 impresses with its more powerful drive: with comparatively low rotation speeds between 1,500 and 3,600 revolutions per minute, the machine generates an impressive 110 kW of drive power. The result is a high throughput: 120 cubic metres per hour (based on water) are possible. Handling particle sizes of up to 30 mm in diameter is no problem for the SM 290. It has a high performance potential that will make your production future-proof.;https://siefer-trigonal.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/siefer_trigonal_sm-290.jpg;https://siefer-trigonal.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/siefer_trigonal_sm-290.jpg;"Technical data | SM 290 | Throughput based on water [m?/h] | 6 – 120
