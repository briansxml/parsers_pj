Pumping Equipment;High Viscous Fluid Pumping Station | HPS;"High Viscous Fluid Pumping Station | HPS
The pumping station is designed for pumping heavy oil at densities not exceeding 1300 kg/m3 and temperatures not exceeding 200ºC. The pumped product viscosity ranges from 20 to 1000 cSt.
ErichHahn HPS Advantages
ErichHahn HPS pumping station models available. They have similar design and composition while differing from each other in terms of capacity, overall dimensions and components.
HPS Gear Motor
The gear motor transmits and converts the rotational motion to the gear pump via a flexible coupling. The frequency converter of the power equipment cabinet is designed for starting the pumping unit and changing its performance.
";https://www.erichhahn.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/HPS-2.png;https://www.erichhahn.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/HPS-2.png, https://www.erichhahn.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/HPSBanner.jpg;"Purpose of Usage | High Pumping Station | HPS The pumping station is designed for pumping heavy oil at densities not exceeding 1300 kg/m3 and temperatures not exceeding 200ºC. The pumped product viscosity ranges from 20 to 1000 cSt.
Gear Pump | The internal gear rotary pump is designed for heavy oil pumping. The pump ensures a uniform supply of pumped product without pulsations to reduce the vibration level of the pumping station, and product foaming. The pump has an integrated safety valve for overpressure protection.
Control Cabinet | The Operation panel of the control cabinet has controls and indicators of the unit’s status. The control cabinet connects to the central control cabinet for communication with the frequency converter. The control station is an integral part of the heavy oil supply pumping station. The controls on the Operation panel of the control cabinet are used to operate the pump startup and performance. The cabinet has indicators of key pump process parameters, power supply availability, and standby status of the pumping station.
Automation | The frequency converter controls the motor. The central control cabinet includes a frequency converter (it is outside the supply scope but still is an integral part of the plant). The control cabinet is connected with the central cabinet with multi-core cables. The control cabinet supports local and remote control modes, and a control off mode. A three-way key switch of the control cabinet is used for switching the modes. In the local mode, operating is exercised from the control cabinet directly (the pump is started, and its performance is controlled using the controls located on the control cabinet door). The remote control mode allows the user to operate the pumping station remotely using the controller equipment and operator workstation depending on the configuration of the central I&C system of the enterprise. All control commands are ignored in the control off mode. All the control cabinets have pump drive service power shutdown switches for on-site power supply shutdown of the pump drive and safe maintenance of the pump.
Loading system | Loading system provides loading of oil products from the storage into trucks. Loading system is equipped with a loading arm, pipelines, shut-off valves and instrumentations.
Heating and Insulation | The pump and filter are heated with thermal oil heating system. All of the units are covered with high density thermal wool insulation and removable protective shells.

Pumping Equipment;Heavy Oil Pumping and Distribution Unit | HPDU;"Heavy Oil Pumping and Distribution Unit | HPDU
ErichHahn HPDU is designed for continuous pumping of heavy oil at process temperatures not exceeding 200°C and pumped product viscosities of 20 to 1000 cSt.
ErichHahn HPDU Advantages
There are various ErichHahn HPDU models available. They have similar designs and compositions while differing from each other in terms of capacity, overall dimensions and components.
HPDU Gear Motor
The manufacturer’s gear motor is designed for transmitting and converting the rotational motion to the gear pump via a flexible coupling.
The frequency converter in the power equipment cabinet is designed for starting the pumping unit and changing its performance.

All the equipment is close mounted on a frame.
3 or 4 Outlet Distributer | It distributes oil product flows among three or four outlets (depending on the unit’s design). The Automated process control system (APCS) controls the flow remotely using electrical actuator butterfly valves.
Gear Pump | The internal gear rotary pump is designed for heavy oil pumping.The pump ensures a uniform supply of pumped oil without pulsations to reduce the vibration level of the pumping station, and product foaming. The pump has an integrated safety valve for overpressure protection.
Control Cabinet | The оperation panel of the control cabinet has controls and indicators of the unit’s operation. The control cabinet connects to the central control cabinet for communication with the frequency converter. The cabinet is an integral part of the automated process control system for supplying heavy oil at the enterprise. The оperation panel of the control cabinet may be used for controlling electrical actuator gate valves, starting the pump, and configuring its rotation speed with the potentiometer. The station has indicators of the pump’s key process parameters, electrical actuator gate valve statuses, grid power supply availability and standby mode.
Automation | The automation system for HPDU units uses remote I/O stations and occupies a heated and ventilated control cabinet (the cabinet can be equipped with a PLC processor module if necessary). A frequency controller is used for controlling the motor. Remote control is implemented via a SCADA system or via other controllers, via the Profinet I/O protocol (Modbus TCP/RTU if required) as well as directly from the control cabinet in the local mode (control of electrical actuator gate valves, pump start-up and frequency settings using controls located on the control cabinet door). The control cabinet also displays the key process parameters (pump current and frequency).
Heavy Oil Filter | The filter is designed for removing mechanical impurities from the pumped product. The process temperature does not exceed 200 °С. The filter consists of a filter shell, a removable cover, and a filter element.
Heating and Insulation | The pump and filter are heated with thermal oil heating system. All of the units are covered with high density thermal wool insulation and removable protective shells.
